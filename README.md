# ft_irc
## IRC server implementation in cpp, a 42 school project

This project was a group project, our group was: https://github.com/qfeuilla + https://github.com/mle-moni

We finished this project in approx. 3 weeks

## INSTALL:

### linux:

tested with debian, ubuntu, change the apt-get calls to the pacman equivalent to get it to work for ARCH
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/mle-moni/ft_irc
cd ft_irc
make install # install dependencies and an IRC client, you might want to change that in the Makefile
make # build the project
```

after this, you get an executable nammed "ircserv"

## START SERVER:

`Usage: ./ircserv [host:port:password] <port> <password>`

- to launch a simple IRC server waiting for non encrypted connections on port 6667, and 6668 for TLS connections:
```zsh
./ircserv 6667 MySecret
```
- replace "MySecret" by whatever you want, it will be usefull to promote an IRC client as an IRC operator

- for testing purposes we put a self signed certificate with a password "toto". This password will be asked when you launch the server

**You should use your own certificate if you want to use the server with real clients**

## HOW TO CONNECT A CLIENT TO THE SERVER:

- open hexchat or any other IRC client, then configure it to connect to the server
- in hexchat, hit CTRL+S, then click on "add", you can enter a name for this new server config, then click on "edit", change the address field on top "newserver/6667" by the actual address ("localhost/6667")
- then you can close the config page, and click "connect" and VOILA!
